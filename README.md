// For the 1st problem 

-> the program will automatically create random word of length =6, like ex:"dgcdyu".

-> the program will create a file "highscore.txt" if it doesn't exists and saves the file with the highestscore in it.

-> *if your current game  score is less than your previous games highscore which are stored in "highscore.txt" file then your highscore will remain same.

-> By default highscore value is assigned to 0.

-> For convenience and to have fun while playing the words will be generated with only lowercase letters

-> If you want the game to challenging and tougher you can replace pool[] in line 15 with (char pool[] = " ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWIXYZabvdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";) and then save file and compile it.

      //Rules and awarding of points

-> to score a positive point you have to type the given word in less than 3 seconds.

-> you will score 2 points if you type in less than 2 seconds.

-> you will score 1 point if you type in less than 3 seconds.

-> you will score 0 points if you type in more than or equal to 3 seconds.

-> you will score -1 point if the given word and the typed word desn't match.

-> score is the total score till now in the current game.

-> do not get score confused with highscore , read the * point .
